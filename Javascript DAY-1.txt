versions:

1.) Es1-Es5 :- bsic syntax, domain manipulations, events and functions (97-99)

2.) Es5     :-big milestone. array.functions, map, filter let const arrow functions classes and modules   

3.) Es6     :- the big update exponential operator released

4.) Es7-Es13:- small yearly updates
